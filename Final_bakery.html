      <p class="intro">I’m someone who loves to do a little bit of everything and I love expressing myself with different types of media. Some of the activities that I've partaken in include, drawing, embroidery, clay sculpting, painting, etc.There is one activity that I have recently been getting more interested in, that activity being baking. Like a lot of people, I like eating sweet things and I have somewhat always been interested in the creation of some of these sweet desserts and being a curious person I started to look into some of these desserts , mainly baked goods. The one I recall doing research on was cake. I find it satisfying seeing something start from practically nothing and turn into something beautiful and delicious so I started watching videos on youtube of people making various cakes of different flavors and decorating them with such intricate yet beautiful detail. One of the youtubers that really got me interested in baking was the channel “How to cook that” in which a food scientist, Ann Reardon, does various activities mainly regarding cakes such as cake challenges, cake ideas and the most popular, cake rescues . What I loved watching these videos for besides the satisfying formation of the cake was the fact that the people who tried the desserts loved the flavors that the cake brought harmoniously together and knowing that that particular dessert was made with love. Naturally as a compassionate person I like seeing my family happy and I thought to myself, what a great way to show my family a piece of love. Since I am not great at showing my emotions I often struggle to let people like my mom or my siblings that I truly appreciate them and baking a special treat  that was made with them in mind is one of the ways that I would like to show this. I’ve tried making cake with cake box mix but I thought it would be better to challenge myself and make something from scratch that would really show my hard work and effort to make a tasty treat (besides flan which me and my mom make together during holidays or birthdays ). In order to be able to gain experience in baking , I decided to interview 3 people who know more about this than me and that have more experience.
