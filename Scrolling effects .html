  <b><u> What even is K-pop?</u></b><br/><br/>
 By any chance do you remember this song? It's not really well known,came out in
 2012. It’s called Gangnam style, performed by Psy and of course I’m kidding Gangnam
 style was intensively popular and there was no way to escape it. I was like 6 years old,
 did not understand the lyrics , but I loved this song, and dancing to it with my cousins. At
 the time I didn’t really know it but this music genre,K-pop, would be something that
 years later I would to put it simply be obsessed with. Now you might be familiar with the
 genre of K-pop or know famous K-pop groups such as BTS and Black Pink. For those
 who aren't too sure what K-pop is, it's essentially just pop music from South Korea but
 it is a bit different from Western pop music as it emphasizes on the intensive training
 process aspiring artists have to go through, visual elements, and incorporation of
 Korean language and culture in its lyrics.Although some people may think that K-pop
 might just be upbeat happy bubbly music, K-pop, just like any kind of music, has
 evolved over the years with different sounds and looks.K-pop can be broken down into
 4 generations, with each generation lasting an average of 7 to 9 years. Within the
 K-pop fandom and even people in the music industry , there is an argument on how
 these generations should be split into. From research I have done , I will break them
 down in the following and will get into the specifics of each generation as well as show
 why each generation was broken down as such.The 1st Generation was from 1992 to
 2003, generation 2 from about 2003- 2012,generation 3 from about 2012- about 2019
 and the 4th Generation from about 2019- today.</p>
    <br/>
   
   <p id="one">  <br/>
       <b><u> Generation 1( 1992 to 2003).</u></b><br/><br>
 Generation 1 is credited to have started with the creation of the group H.O.T, by
 SMentertainment, a prominent figure in the k-pop scene. Although there were some
 early groups like SoBangCha and Seo Taiji and Boys which could be credited as some
 of the first K-pop groups, many fans and experts actually credit the group H.O.T. as the
 first K-pop group as it not only popularized the concept of a K-pop group but also was
 highly manufactured and made up of trained pop stars. Other groups that were really
 popular from this era were Sechs Kies, S.E.S,Fin.K.L,Baby vox,shinhwa,and
 g.o.d.Dances in this era were simpler compared to today's era but they were important
 nonetheless since it is what set the ground for future generations and the fact that
 K-pop idols should not only sing/rap but also be able to perform. Many fans would
 obviously go to their favorite idols' performances live since there was no internet and
 this was one of the best ways to see them and also to cheer them on. It’s not really
 known when this happened but eventually the fans brought balloons and raincoats in
 the color that represented the group to further cheer and let the idols know how many
 dedicated fans they had.Of course I can't mention generation 1 of K-pop without
 mentioning the infamous fan wars. Fans of this K-pop era were known to be quite
 aggressive when it came to defending their groups, they believed their group was the
best out of all of them and the true idols. They could be as bad as just badmouthing the
 other groups and their fandoms or setting a literal car on fire . The most well known
 among these fan wars were those of the Sechs Kies and H.O.T. The day was December
 5th 1998, the day of the end of the year golden disc awards(which still go on today).The
 biggest prize was about to be handed out and both Sechs Kies and H.O.T. were some
 of the nominees along with some other artists . Before the awards even began, about
 250 fans of both groups met outside the venue despite the pouring rain, they held their
 yellow and white balloons as they threw insults to each other and eventually one thing
 let to another and fans began pulling hair ,popping balloons, throwing punches, and
 hitting each other with umbrellas. The fight was so severe that the police had to be
 called to calm things down and the fight was even reported in the news. The fans
 however did not care, all they cared for was for their favorites to win but the ironic thing
 was that neither H.O.T. or Sechs Kies won the award , instead an artist called Kim
 Jong-Hwan , a ballad singer got the award. Funnily enough these same fans were
 comforting one another over the loss of their beloved groups at the end of the award
 show.</p>

     <p id="two">
         <b><u>Generation 2( 2003 to 2012).</u></b><br/><br>
 If you recall, SM Entertainment, the company who created H.O.T. , is a prominent
 and arguably the biggest K-pop company. Since they were the ones who “started it all”,
 many people look at them as the company who starts the “new generation”.So when in
 2003 they debuted their new boy five-member boy group TVXQ, many, myself included,
 consider this the beginning of gen2.The second generation is often dubbed as the
 golden age of K-pop with Groups like Super Junior, BIGBANG, Girls’ Generation,
 Wonder Girls, KARA, 2PM, 2NE1, and one of my favorite groups, SHINee. This
 generation probably gave the most iconic songs to date, like Gee by Girls Generation,
 Replay by SHINee, Sorry Sorry by Super Junior, I Am The Best by 2NE1, and
 FANTASTIC BABY by BIGBANG.Rather than being focused on having more classical
 sounding music like a majority of gen1, This era’s music focused on giving listeners
 earworm syndrome ( songs that would basically get stuck in your head) . They also
 were the years when subunits were born. The very first sub-unit ,Super Junior-K.R.Y ,
 was founded in 2006.This subunit was of the group super junior(who at the time had 13
 members) and consists of the three main vocals Kihyun, Ryeowook and Yesung.
 This era’s dances also differed as they were more advanced than generation 1
 and not only focused on choreographed and synchronized dances but also in
 experimenting with the music and its concepts. Two groups that are a good example of
 this are the groups f(x) and SHINee which incorporated elements of electro-pop and
 synth-pop into their songs. Fashion-wise, this generation was more experimental and
 eccentric compared to the last. Girls sported outfits that were poppy and colorful,
whereas, guys were seen in suits, tees, jeans, and even shirtless sometimes. Common
 makeup from this era included bold eye makeup often paired with accessories like
 earrings, caps, necklaces, and wristbands. Notably, many groups or certain members of
 the group were known to change their hair colors with every comeback. I also want to
 mention that this is where 7 year contracts in kpop started being created and is also
 where the term “7 year curse” came from since a majority of the groups would not
 renew their contracts after they ended .Many groups from this generation like Super
 Junior(since 2005), SHINee(since 2008), Apink(since 2011), Girls Generation( since
 2007), and TVXQ(since 2003) are currently active and have broken the infamous
 ‘7-year curse’ in K-Pop.
 This generation also started the trend of incorporating photocards into albums
 and using lightsticks at concerts. The first album with photo cards was released by Girls
 Generation in 2010 with "Oh!" But although from then on their label (SM entertainment)
 included photo cards more often in their artists' albums (for example in SHINee's album
 "Lucifer"(2010) it still took a while for the trend to be picked up by the rest of the K-pop
 scene. As for lightsticks, they were invented by member G-Dragon from the boy group
 Big Bang because he wanted to have something that V.I.P (Big Bang fans) could be
 identified with at festivals where several artists were performing. Like the first
 generation, this one was still very much dominated by the Big 3- SM Entertainment,
 JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment . Many of the most popular and successful
 groups of the time were produced by these three labels. Also, major milestones and
 significant developments were achieved mainly by artists from these three labels.</p>

         <b><u>Generation 3 (2012- 2019)</u></b><br/><br>
 The group that kicked off this generation was EXO debuting on april 8,2012, and
 as you probably guessed by now, this is another group from SM Entertainment.The
 argument for this generation is that there were certain groups like B.A.P or EXID that
 debuted earlier in the year (january and february respectively) that there are
 disagreements on whether they are still part of the second generation or already part of
 the third generation. There are even some that count a couple of 2011 bands as third
 generation already, but in general the majority has agreed on 2012 and EXO as the
 starting point. This generation included even more variety in their music style and dived
 deep into concepts so much so that some even created universes. School/teen
 concepts, self-love and exploration, and girl crush became popular concepts for this
 generation. Since school concepts were popular in the first half of the generation, so
 were school uniforms. In the second half, groups transitioned to soft pastels or
 brightly-colored looks and appeared stylish with outfits inspired by fashion weeks. Boy
groups in particular started to incorporate more color in their outfits. Makeup was for a
 lack of a better word “angsty” at first, with boys wearing heavy eyeliner around the eyes,
 this later changed to a more neutral and pastel palette. Some of the most popular songs
 at the time were “CALL ME BABY” (by EXO), “Ice Cream Cake” (by Red Velvet), , “TT”
 (by TWICE), “AS IF IT’S YOUR LAST” (by BLACKPINK) and “Blood, Sweat and Tears” (by
 BTS). If you were wondering, this is also the generation that the song Gangnam style
 which i mentioned in the beginning was released.One of the important aspects in K-pop
 culture that was popularized by gen3 were survival shows.These survival shows were
 either for forming a permanent group like twice or ikon, or temporary groups like ioi. The
 permanent groups, as they imply would be for a group that would follow the traditional
 contract of 7 years in k-pop, and the temporary groups would be a way for an aspiring
 kpop idol to gain experience in the industry and eventually join a permanent group.
 There is no way that I can leave out the most important part of gen3 of kpop and
 it is the debut of now international superstars, BTS in the year 2013.Despite being the
 most popular K-pop group now, they actually have very humble beginnings. They came
 from a small company known as big hit entertainment and to put it simply bighit was a
 dying company on the verge of bankruptcy. Their initial music like their debut song no
 more dream weren’t the most popular at first.It was only in 2015 when the group was on
 the verge of disbandment that they released their first hit song “ I Need U” , which won
 them their first music show trophy and even took 3rd place in the Billboard's World
 Digital Song Sales Charts.From there BTS only kept growing and made their
 international breakthrough with their album “ You Never Walk Alone” in 2017. In May of
 that year they won the award for Top Social Artist at the 24th Billboard Music Awards. It
 was the first time ever that a K-pop group won a Billboard Award and Moreover, BTS
 beat out global star Justin Bieber, who had consistently claimed the award for the past
 six years. This was the big breakthrough of K-pop in the west and it was actually
 because of BTS that I discovered K-pop for a second time in late 2019.</p>

         <b><u>Generation 4 (2019-2023)</u></b><br><br>
 You would probably think that based on the previous pattern that SM would debut a new
 group thus starting the new generation of K-pop and I wouldn’t blame you but this time
 the new generation is considered to have started when Bighit entertainment debuted
 their new Boy group TOMORROW X TOGETHER(my favorite k-pop group by the way).
 This generation is known as the “ Viral generation” with popular groups like Stray Kids,
 ateez, (G)i-dle, TXT(TOMORROW X TOGETHER), ITZY, ENHYPEN, aespa, IVE, LE
 SSERAFIM, and NewJeans.Even though the choreography in K-pop only kept
 improving each generation , this generation is known to have complex dances and have
 proved to have excelled with innovation, speed, and difficulty levels. Noticeably, there
 has been an increased focus on creating easy hooks for building viral social media
challenges.The production of music videos are also expected to be as perfect as
 possible and are edited extensively to provide the best quality to the fans.This
 generation has explored darker and bolder concepts, Sci-Fi and self-love, a theme
 that’s been used to its fullest. The 4th generation has also seen the birth of virtual or AI
 idols like MAVE. Both fashion and makeup have been the most experimental to date. It
 is very theatrical and a majority is from luxury brands like Chanel and louis vuitton.
 Outfits these days either focus on the individual personality of the artist or the concept,
 and are less about being coordinated between members. Some of the most popular
 songs from this generation are Popular songs include “Queen card”(by g-idle) “Bouncy”
 ( by ATEEZ), “WANNABE” (by ITZY), “God’s Menu” (by Stray Kids), “Savage” (by
 aespa), “0X1=LOVESONG” (by TXT ft. Seori), “Polaroid Love” (by ENHYPEN),
 “Antifragile'' (by LE SSERAFIM), “Love dive” (by IVE)and “Hype Boy” (by NewJeans). A
 big part of the fandoms are made up of international fans, a lot coming from the US.This
 generation also is known to provide a lot of fanservice to their fans as well as a lot of
 content on social media such as tiktok.</p>
     <br/>
     <div id="gen4"></div>
     <br/>
     <p id="five">
         <b><u>What now,? Is gen4 really over?</u></b><br/><br/>
 The biggest argument right now of gen4 is if it has ended. In early September SM
 entertainment made an announcement that it would debut a new boy group called
 “Riize”, in this announcement they claimed that in doing so the start of gen5 of K-pop
 would begin. This caused massive outroar in the k-pop community since a lot of people
 do not think gen4 should end this early. At first i wasn't too sure what to think of this.
 Afterall SM was at least before gen4, the company that really determined the start of a
 new generation of kpop but as was shown in gen4, not every generation has to be
 determined by SM entertainment.Initally when  listening to some of the newer boy groups that
 had debuted during this era  like xikers,boy next door, zerobase1,tws, and ofcourse Riize, 
i thought that there wasn't much difference to the music . But after some time after listening 
to more releases and seeing the age gap between gen4 and the newer groups i'm inclined to agree 
 with the idea that gen5 of  kpop is is its early stages.
 Like in every other generation, this is something that K-pop fans and
 music experts will likely not agree on but also like in the other generations there is an
 eventual resolve , which honestly makes me excited and wanting to see how this genre
 of music that is really dear to me will continue evolving.</p>
