<h2>Who am I ?</h2>
<p>  ☆My name is Anabel Moreno , I was born Here in Chicago Illinois on May 11th 2005.
 <br/> ☆ I am  a freshman and am currently majoring in programming and I hope I can learn a lot more about my interests in the future.
<br/>  ☆One of the things that I love doing drawing  and I've been doing it ever since I can remember.Not only do I draw in my freetime,but I also do needle felting, embroidery,paint , and work with clay.
<br/> ☆ For my music preferences i don't really mind any type of music but my favorite music to listen to is rock and kpop.My favorite rock band are the Oral cigarettes and my favorite kpop groups are shinee and txt. 
<br/> ☆I like watching anime(though i haven't watched much of it recently). I mainly watch the action ones like attack on titan and vinland saga.My favorite anime would have to be Jojo's bizarre adventure, I'm not sure why it is my favorite but I really enjoy the artstyle so it might be because of that.
