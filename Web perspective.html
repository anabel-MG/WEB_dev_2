 <p>&emsp;&emsp;“AI will replace humans” is something you might have heard of in recent times with the rise of AI .Over the years we’ve seen how technology and AI have drastically been improving and how it is slowly being incorporated into our lives. I personally first heard of AI more frequently when it was being brought up online by several artists who said that their art was being stolen to create “AI art” and how it threatened to replace art. 
Upon hearing this I like many artists began to worry of how this would affect our art and the future. While there were those who were scared and panicked there were also those who did not think AI could replace art as it was unoriginal,boring, and could not create truly original content. For the most part I am somewhat in the middle in that I agree that AI could potentially steal jobs but it wouldn’t do it very well.</p>
<br> 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I noticed some parallels from this situation and from the article , “Design is dead. And we have killed it” , by Michael F. Buckley. This article brings up this problem that digital designers are facing and also talks about how AI is slowly starting to take over in some areas such as taking potential site visitors from a website. In the article it states
 “ If not already, users will go to their favorite AI application and ask the same question about green tea. But this time, they will not have to sift through dozens of designed websites. And instead of going to an online store to purchase green tea, they will just ask AI to recommend the best tea based on your given parameters. No more searching through hundreds of products to find the right one.” This quote talks about how in the past when looking up a question online people would go to various websites to get an answer but now most would go directly to AI to answer their questions. This is bad for the designers of the site since they lose a potential visitor. The article also mentions how there are sites like wix that further enable the AI takeover , to quote from the article, “ The greatest fear many have is that AI will take over designers’ jobs. After all, technology currently exists that can perform some of the perceived tasks of a designer faster and cheaper than we can. For example, Wix and Framer offer excellent AI- integrated web-building tools. With just a few prompts and clicks, non-designers can have a fully designed website up and running in a matter of minutes”, While this might be easier for someone to utilize, especially someone who doesn’t know how to make websites or that might be on a budget i think the most damage is done when bigger and more established companies rob someone of a job by going the easy route and use something like this.</p>
<br> 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;While I agree that it is possible that AI might be taking some jobs, I don't think it does a very good job at it since it is too bland looking and unoriginal. To create something in the first place, it needs input  to learn from, for example to have it produce “ art” it needs some pieces so it can learn and replicate the style. The problem with AI is that it is literally a machine it will have no creativity in it which is a big component in creating anything original, as a result AI products , especially “AI art” , end up looking soulless and even misshapen for the most part. This, at least for me, would keep me from using AI if I were someone with some type of business since it would make my business look unpresentable and make me look like a messy person . While I do acknowledge that there are those who would like to cut corners in order to save money, there are also those who care about the overall result of a product made by a person. This is why currently, while I am wary of AI and how it could affect my future, I try not to let it affect me too much because it could never really do a good of a job as a human.
